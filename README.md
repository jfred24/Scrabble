Development state of both programs:

BoardBuilder:
  All the objectives were accomplished and several improvements were made:
	-The size of the board can go from 4x4 to 20x20. The value can be chosen,
or made random by the program, depending on the user's choice.
	-The user can choose the coordinates and the words themselves, have the words be chosen randomly by the program,
or have both the coordinates and the words be random.
	-The user may also select the number of words with a cap depending on the size of the board
	-The resulting board may be saved to a file and the user is allowed to make a different board 
if need be (different boards can be made and saved without restarting the program)
